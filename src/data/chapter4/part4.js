    "If you’ve been following earlier prep work, you may already have enough Heron Plumes for Exotics III. If not, make one more trip to Bayou NWA to gather what’s missing, while also picking off alligators from horseback to progress Horseman 8.",
    "Back in Saint Denis, complete 'Brothers and Sisters, One and All,' a quick story mission with Brother Dawkins. Then return to Shady Belle to trigger Strauss’ 'Money Lending and Other Sins – V.' While at camp, keep an eye out for Pearson’s optional hunting quest, which guarantees Gator Eggs if you don’t yet have 25.",
    "Next, approach Mary Beth to start 'No, No and Thrice, No.' Spare Anthony Foreman at the end for an extra bounty opportunity later in the Epilogue. Since this mission ends near Rhodes, use the opportunity to complete the Mark Johnson bounty.",
    "Head south of Shady Belle to hunt the Legendary Panther, 'Giaguaro.' This will complete Master Hunter 10 and also tick off the last of the 5 Legendary Animals required for 100%. While in the area, collect 5 Ghost Orchids east of Shady Belle.",
    "Return to Bayou NWA to gather both Cigar Orchids and Acuna’s Star Orchids, while also progressing Horseman 8 with more alligator kills from horseback. Finally, stop in Bluewater Marsh to complete the Black Belle Stranger mission — the last of the gunslinger encounters from the photo set."
