    "Start this section by heading to Emerald Ranch. Steal a coach and sell it to the Wagon Fence to progress Bandit 8. The most efficient method is to ride a stagecoach from Valentine, arrive at Emerald Ranch, steal it, and sell it. Fast travel back to Valentine, then repeat the process.",
    "Next, sit down at Emerald Ranch station to play Dominoes for Gambler 9. This is one of the easiest spots to win 3 games in a row — but only if there’s one opponent. If more appear, leave and return later.",
    "Head west to Twin Stack Pass, gathering Yarrow along the way (especially valuable if you’re carrying the Legend of the East Satchel, as you can collect the full 30 needed for Herbalist 7 here). While in the area, climb one of the stacks and snipe a passerby on the road to complete Sharpshooter 6. Then meet Eagle Flies for the story mission 'American Fathers – II.' This mission is also ideal for completing Sharpshooter 7 (7 headshots in a row) if you bring enough Dead Eye tonics.",
    "West of Wallace Station in Big Valley, West Elizabeth is a great spot for Master Hunter 7 — use bait to lure both predator and herbivore. From there, follow Little Creek River to gather Burdock Root for Herbalist 7 and craft more Miracle Tonics (target 4/5 here).",
    "Next, collect Lady Slipper Orchids in Big Valley. One requires clearing the gang hideout at Hanging Dog Ranch. Use stealth bow kills to progress Weapons Expert 9, then hogtie the last gang member and leave him on the tracks for Bandit 9.",
    "South of Hanging Dog Ranch, visit Lake Owanjila to complete Master Hunter 8 by shooting fish with your pistol — they don’t wash away as quickly as they do in rivers. Then, east of Fort Riggs at night, find an Opossum and let it play dead before killing it for Master Hunter 9.",
    "On the way back, stop by Cumberland Falls to find the first High Stakes Treasure Map for Explorer 8. Finally, clear Six Point Cabin — stealth bow kills progress Weapons Expert 9, disarm three enemies with Dead Eye for Sharpshooter 8, and hogtie another for Bandit 9."
