    "Start this section by heading east of Saint Denis to Bluewater Marsh to hunt a Bullfrog for Mrs. Hobbs’ 4th Hunting Request. Once that’s complete, begin working through Herbalist 6 by picking 15 different herb species. If you’ve been gathering plants since Herbalist 5, you may already have progress — but following the suggested route ensures you’ll collect enough.",
    "This path naturally leads you near Butcher Creek, where you can also gather Moccasin Flower Orchids for the Exotics questline.",
    "From there, travel north along the Kamassa River. Here you should be able to collect several Hunting Request animals in one trip: a Sparrow, a Songbird, and a Toad. Then move east toward the railroad tracks to hunt a cougar for Master Hunter 6 (if you haven’t already completed this challenge through random encounters).",
    "While in the area, gather Golden Currants to prepare for Herbalist 7 by crafting Miracle Tonics (target at least 2 of the 5 required). At night, search for a Skunk to finish the Hunting Request. Be patient, as perfect Skunks can be rare — saving and reloading may help. Finally, send the completed Hunting Request to Mrs. Hobbs at the Annesburg Post Office before the carcass spoils, then check in with Marko Dragic at Dover Hill for the next step of 'A Bright Bouncing Boy' (only available at night)."
