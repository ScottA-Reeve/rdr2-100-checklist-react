    "The first priority in Chapter 4 is locating and rescuing Jack. After completing 'Angelo Bronte, a Man of Honor', you should continue with 'The Gilded Cage' to unlock further missions, including the Exotics questline. During the party, save Algernon Wasp from choking — this earns you his business card, which makes his marker visible at a distance.",
    "Afterwards, you’ll return to Shady Belle, where you may receive a letter from Mary Linton. This optional side quest involves taking Mary to the theatre — which you’ll need for 100% completion anyway. Following this, visit Algernon to start the Exotics quest. If you’ve been collecting plumes earlier in the guide, you should already have enough Egret plumes. Otherwise, you can gather more while collecting Lady of the Night Orchids in Bayou NWA. While doing so, you can also progress Horseman 8 by killing animals from horseback (alligators make easy, slow-moving targets).",
    "Once complete, return to Algernon to continue the Exotics strand, and also check in on new Stranger Missions like 'Help a Brother Out', 'American Fathers – I', and 'A Bright Bouncing Boy'."
