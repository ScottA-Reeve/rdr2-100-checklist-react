    "Deliver the Spoonbill plumes and Orchids to Algernon in Saint Denis to trigger the final Exotics request. While in the city, meet Trelawny to begin 'A Fine Night of Debauchery.' This mission is perfect for Gambler 10, as you’ll automatically win two scripted poker hands — leaving you just one victory away from completing the challenge afterward.",
    "After the mission, save your game and head to any poker table (Flatneck Station is a good option). Go all in on the first hand — if you win or split, you’ll complete Gambler 10 thanks to the two scripted wins from earlier.",
    "Next, travel east of Shady Belle to collect 5 Clamshell Orchids. Return to Saint Denis and pick up the Lyndsay Wofford bounty poster. On your way to capture him at Mossy Flats, gather 5 Queen’s Orchids in Bayou NWA and Bluewater Marsh. While at Mossy Flats, don’t forget to grab the unique Civil War Knife in the basement. When bounty hunters ambush you on the return trip, you can briefly hogtie Wofford and leave him on the tracks to finish Bandit 9.",
    "Once Wofford is turned in, buy a train ticket to Annesburg. Stay onboard as it departs, and once the train crosses into Ambarino, rob a passenger to begin Bandit 10. Disembark quickly and escape before lawmen arrive. Then head south into Grizzlies East to collect 5 Dragon Mouth Orchids and visit a shack for your 100% tracker.",
    "Cross into Roanoke Ridge and follow a collection route to pick up 2 Rock Carvings, 5 Dreamcatchers, 3 Dinosaur Bones, and 2 weapons. The route ends with 10 Sparrow’s Egg Orchids, completing the Exotics questline at last. Return to Algernon in Saint Denis to receive your final reward.",
    "To wrap up Bandit 10, continue robbing trains — Wallace Station is recommended for its easy escape routes. With challenges and collectibles largely complete, focus on the final 4 story missions of Chapter 4: 'Urban Pleasures,' 'Country Pursuits,' 'Revenge is a Dish Best Eaten,' and 'Banking, the Old American Art.'",
    "Good news: almost all of the grindy collectibles and challenges are now complete. You can now concentrate on finishing the story missions with fewer distractions."
