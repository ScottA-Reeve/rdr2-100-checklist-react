    "From there, gather another batch of plants in the Heartlands, then head to Cumberland Forest to finalize the Dinosaur Bones quest with Deborah MacGuiness. You may need to wait for her invitation to appear.",
    "Continue south: ford Flat Iron Lake to the islands and kill a crab for crustacean meat, then work through Bayou NWA to pick more herbs and collect big game meat from an alligator.",
    "Stop by Elysian Pool for a perfect bat, then gather the final plants in Roanoke Ridge to finish Herbalist 9. While there, look for a Blue Jay for Mrs. Hobbs’ hunting request.",
    "Catch a sockeye salmon at O’Creagh’s Run, break it down for succulent fish, and grab a goat near Lagras for mutton. Finally, finish Jeremy Gill’s quest to complete the Legendary Fish storyline, and prepare flaky fish from a Rock Bass.",
    "Optionally, hunt the Legendary Pronghorn in Rio Bravo for a unique trinket, though it’s not required for 100%."
