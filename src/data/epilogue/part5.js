    "You’re on the home straight now. Part V is where you’ll finish the final story missions, wrap up Hunting Requests, complete Herbalist 10, and prepare for the endgame content.",
    "Begin at Beecher’s Hope with 'Uncle’s Bad Day' and 'Trying Again'. Afterwards, head to Lake Owanjila to hunt a perfect Beaver for Mrs. Hobbs’ final Hunting Request, then post it at Strawberry before it spoils.",
    "On the way back, hunt a rabbit (game meat) and a turkey (plump bird meat). At Blackwater’s butcher, you can purchase venison, pork, and beef if you don’t already have them. These, combined with other meats you’ve collected earlier, will allow you to complete Herbalist Challenge 10 by cooking and seasoning all 11 types of meat.",
    "Next, complete 'A Really Big Bastard'. Afterward, visit a Trapper to buy any remaining reinforced equipment — this is essential for maxing out Health, Stamina, and Deadeye, required for 100%.",
    "Check your mail for an invitation from Mrs. Hobbs. Meet her north of Strawberry to conclude the Hunting Request storyline and receive the Squirrel Statue. Place it back at Beecher’s Hope to officially finish the questline.",
    "Finally, play through 'A New Future Imagined' and the epic finale 'American Venom'. Use seasoned big game meat beforehand to give yourself gold cores — it will last through the mission.",
    "Once the story ends, honor your comrades by visiting all 9 graves. Leave the most significant one for last to unlock the 'Paying Respects' cutscene alongside the coveted 'Best in the West' achievement."
