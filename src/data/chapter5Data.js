    "Chapter 5 is one of the shortest in the game, set primarily on the island of Guarma. After washing ashore, you’ll have a very limited window of free roam before missions start chaining together automatically.",
    "Nothing in Guarma counts toward the 100% completion statistic, but there are 7 unique animal species on the island. If you want a full compendium without glitching back later, you must study, track, kill, and skin each species before starting 'A Kind and Benevolent Despot.'",
    "Once you return to the mainland, your camp is set up at Lakay. This is an ideal time to catch the Legendary Longnose Gar, which also completes Survivalist Challenge 9. Note: the fish icon may not appear on your map due to the camp’s proximity, but it can still be caught.",
    "Although technically classified as a Chapter 6 mission, 'Icarus and Friends' feels appropriate to complete here to pace out John’s rescue. When starting 'That’s Murfree Country,' bring a bow and choose the stealth approach. You can finish Weapons Expert 9 here by killing unaware enemies with your bow. You can also loot a machete from the Murfree brood to add another required weapon toward 100%."
