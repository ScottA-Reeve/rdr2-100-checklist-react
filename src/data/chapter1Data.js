    `Chapter 1 is fairly limited. Most of the missions auto-start, and the weather won't allow you to leave camp on your own in free-roam - your horse will collapse and die rapidly in the cold.`,
    `However, there are a couple of challenges to look out for within the missions. There's a slight choice you have to make on the order of the missions here, which doesn't materially affect your quest for 100%, but does influence the ease of getting gold.`,
    `The mission "Old Friends" unlocks the use of Dead Eye, and you can do this before "The Aftermath of Genesis" if you prefer as Dead Eye will make it slightly easier to get a clean kill on the deer. However, in terms of chronology and story authenticity, it feels to me more likely Arthur would go out in search of food first, hence the chosen order below.`,

  outroText: [
    `You will also get the first of 6 gangs automatically added, some weapons, equipment and animals to the compendium however you play. Other than that, this is very much a case of enjoying some introductory missions.`,
