      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 - 100% Completion Guide</h1>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <div className="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this guide is to set out a strategy to achieve 100%
          completion as efficiently as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key difference between this and many other guides on the internet
          is that it outlines the <strong>optimal order</strong> to complete
          every task required. An unplanned approach to getting the
          <em> Best in the West </em> Achievement/Trophy is likely to take well
          over 100 hours, so there are significant time savings from optimising
          the order you approach each requirement in.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining collectibles, challenges, and other tasks when you’re in
          the right location, this guide reduces the number of times you need to
          revisit the same spots. It also identifies missions where you can
          complete challenges more easily than in free roam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having now reached 100% on multiple occasions, I expect this should
          save at least 10 hours off your completion time — quite possibly more
          — and reduce repetition and retries, lowering frustration and allowing
          you to enjoy the experience more thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide will not focus on tasks that are not required for 100%, but
          it does include optional recommendations for side activities that can
          make the main quest much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spoilers:</strong> Whilst I’ll try to keep them to a minimum,
          inevitably talking about full completion involves some, so proceed at
          your own risk.

        <h2>Overall Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          First, it’s worth considering the full list of activities required
          according to the in-game checklist. It looks intimidating, but not all
          tasks actually need separate planning since some overlap or happen
          naturally during story progression.
        </p>

        <h3>Superfluous Tasks</h3>
        <p>
          Some checklist items are covered by challenges or other requirements,
          so you don’t need to track them separately:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>10 Fish (covered by Survivalist Challenge 10)</li>
          <li>10 Horses (covered by Horseman Challenge 10)</li>
          <li>20 Plants (covered by Herbalist Challenge 9)</li>
          <li>4 Table Games (covered by Gambler Challenges)</li>
          <li>
            6 Recipes crafted (covered by Challenges and Mission progression)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 Treasure Hunter Chain (covered by the Explorer Challenge)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tasks That Require No Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Some objectives will happen naturally during a full playthrough:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete all Story Missions</li>
          <li>25 Chance Encounters</li>
          <li>Bushwhacked event</li>
          <li>50 Animals studied</li>
          <li>10 Equipment entries</li>
          <li>6 Gangs encountered</li>
          <li>Horse Bonding Level 4</li>
          <li>
            5 Ranters, Ravers, and Campaigners (random encounters on the map)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Planning Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Some tasks are significantly easier to complete at certain times. For
          example, the Gang Hideout “Six Point Cabin” makes many challenges
          simple, but it’s no longer available after Chapter 6 mission
          <em> Goodbye, Dear Friend</em>. Other tasks (like Dinosaur Bones or
          Hunting Requests) can’t be fully completed until after Chapter 6.
        </p>

        <h3>Tasks to Complete Before Chapter 6 Ends</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>10 Stranger Missions</li>
          <li>5 Bounties</li>
          <li>144 Cigarette Cards</li>
          <li>All Exotics</li>
          <li>10 Rock Carvings</li>
          <li>20 Dreamcatchers</li>
          <li>5 Shacks</li>
          <li>5 Legendary Animals</li>
          <li>4 Robberies</li>
          <li>Most Challenges (Bandit, Explorer, Gambler, Sharpshooter, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tasks Best Left for After Chapter 6</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>30 Dinosaur Bones</li>
          <li>13 Legendary Fish</li>
          <li>All Hunting Requests (most easily done later)</li>
          <li>Final Herbalist and Horseman Challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Before the end of Chapter 6, spend any cash you have since it won’t
          carry over. Buy all remaining weapons, and stock up on Premium
          Cigarettes to complete the card collection. Gold Bars can be saved as
          they persist into the Epilogue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tasks, like the Exotic bird hunting and Gambler Challenge 8, are
          time-consuming and luck-based. The key is to break them up alongside
          other activities to avoid frustration.
